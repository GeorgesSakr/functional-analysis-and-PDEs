# Weak-Form Solutions of Drift–Diffusion PDEs via Functional Analysis

This project presents a rigorous functional-analytic treatment of a family of drift–diffusion partial differential equations (PDEs).

We

1. Prove the Lax–Milgram theorem in the symmetric case and use it to establish existence and uniqueness of weak solutions for elliptic problems.  
2. Formulate and solve a steady-state drift–diffusion equation on the upper-right quarter unit disk (Ω ⊂ ℝ²) with mixed Dirichlet–Neumann conditions.  
3. Analyse the solution operator `T : L²(Ω) → H₀` proving boundedness, compactness, and describing its spectrum via the Fredholm alternative.  
4. Solve an associated Sturm–Liouville eigenvalue problem, obtaining an infinite countable spectrum `{λₙ}` with `λₙ → ∞`.  
5. Extend the framework to the time-dependent drift–diffusion PDE, cast it in semi-variational form, and apply Lions’ theorem to prove well-posedness with an energy estimate `E(t)`.  
6. Discuss applicability of Picard’s theorem for an abstract second-order evolution equation in a Hilbert space setting.
